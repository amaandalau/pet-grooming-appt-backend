# Pet Grooming Appointment Booking System

### **Brief Overview**
The pet grooming appointment booking system is an application designed to facilitate the scheduling and management of pet grooming services. It serves as a centralized platform connecting pet owners, groomers and administrators to streamline the entire appointment booking process.


Pet owners can create an account by providing their personal information and details about their pets. They can view a list of available groomers, each with their specialization, experience and availability. The system allows pet owners to schedule appointments by selecting their preferred groomer, date and time slot.


Once an appointment is scheduled, the system sends out a confirmation email/notifications to both the pet owner and the chosen groomer. Reminders are also sent prior to the appointment to minimize the chances of missed appointments. Pet owners can track the status of their appointments, and if necessary, they can request cancellations or reschedule appointments within a specific time frame.


The system offers features to manage availability, allowing pet groomers to set their working hours, days off and vacation periods. This ensures that pet owners can only book appointments during the groomersâ€™ available time slots. Groomers can view their schedules, including upcoming appointments and any changes made by pet owners.


After an appointment is completed, pet owners have the opportunity to provide feedback and rate their grooming experience. This feedback helps other users make informed decisions when selecting a groomer. 


Administrators have access to a dedicated dashboard where they can manage user accounts, groomer profiles and appointments. 

The pet grooming appointment booking system simplifies the process of finding and scheduling grooming services for pets.
